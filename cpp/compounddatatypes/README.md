# Compound data types

Compound data types (also sometimes called composite data types) are data types that can be constructed from fundamental data types (or other compound data types). Each compound data type has its own unique properties as well.

C++ supports the following compound types:

* Functions
* Arrays
* Pointer types:
* Pointer to object
* Pointer to function
* Pointer to member types:
* Pointer to data member
* Pointer to member function
* Reference types:
* L-value references
* R-value references
* Enumerated types:
* Unscoped enumerations
* Scoped enumerations
* Class types:
* Structs
* Classes
* Unions
