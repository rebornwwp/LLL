'''
How many ways can you make the sum of a number?

From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)#

In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. If order matters, the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
Examples

Trivial

sum(-1) # 0
sum(1) # 1
Basic

sum(2) # 2  -> 1+1 , 2
sum(3) # 3 -> 1+1+1, 1+2, 3
sum(4) # 5 -> 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, 2+2, 4
sum(5) # 7 -> 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+3, 1+2+2, 1+4, 5, 2+3

sum(10) # 42
