# Testcase Example:  '[2,2,3,2]'
#
# Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times except
# for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
#
# Note:
#
# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it without using extra memory?
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [2,2,3,2]
# Output: 3
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
# Output: 99
