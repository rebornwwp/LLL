# Testcase Example:  '{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}'
#
# A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
# pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
#
# Return a deep copy of the list.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input:
#
# {"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}
#
# Explanation:
# Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
# Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer
# points to itself.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# You must return the copy of the given headÂ as a reference to the cloned list.
#
#

# Definition for a Node.
